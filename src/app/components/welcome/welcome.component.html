    <p>SIX PIXELS was created with the idea to move to an PURE CSS UI framework/pattern lab.</p>
    <p>There are so many amazing frameworks out there that is gets hard to choose which one. A lot of the frameworks under the hood have very complex SASS or LESS being written which can get hard to follow, or just be a bit for someone wanting to customize slightly. A lot of the heavy hitter frameworks also come with a heavy page weight, in instances of 100kb+. That is really not all that bad, but dump a theme on top, write custom css for your project are all real world things. My goal was to create a base framework, that gives you out of the box browser support following the principles laid out by Brad Frost. Atomic Design/Pattern Labs and retrofit that idea to css. With it being small you have just that much more play with custom code before you even reach to base filesize of some of the other frameworks. I also used a single variable file and went with a more readable code approach so it should be easy for you to fork and customize without the need for a theme. You can even fork and create a theme, I will leave the imagination of up to you.</p>
    <p>Here are the key benefits to using SIX PIXELS</p>

    <div class="sg-divider"></div>

    <div>
      <h2>Current filesize minified: 41kb</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="sg-divider"></div>

    <ul class="spx-list">
      <li>Light weight</li>
      <li>1 variable file for easy customization</li>
      <li>IE support for 10 and above</li>
      <li>Uses no webfonts, only system level fonts</li>
      <li>Built on an atomic level for minimal trumping</li>
      <li>All components are scoped to its component</li>
      <li>Optional includes for components</li>
      <li>Namespace support(scss compiling required)</li>
      <li>ZERO JS/External dependancies</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

    <br>
    <p><code>npm install</code> Installs dependencies from our package.json</p>
    <br>
    <p><code>npm start</code> Starts the local instance and runs our sass with gulp</p>
    <br>

    <h2>Guidelines</h2>
    <p>6PIXELS is meant to be a next gen CSS UI FRAMEWORK / PATTERN LAB, and can present progressive enhancement. Please use the <code>@supports</code>. Progressive enhancement code should live at the top of your SCSS file.</p>
    <p>Everything should be created with MOBILE FIRST in mind.</p>
    <p>Everything should be in increments of 6 PIXELS. This creates specific patterns and expectations.</p>
    <p>With any new elements/components please supply a new route, along with at least one live example and code example.</p>

    <h2>Code Markers</h2>
    <p>
      Here are markers to use with the code at the top of the elements docs.
    </p>
    <p><span class="spx-pill spx-pill--pr">Stable</span><p>
    <p><span class="spx-pill spx-pill--sd">Working</span></p>
    <p><span class="spx-pill spx-pill--g3">Progressive</span></p>
    <div class="sg-divider"></div>
    <h2>Code Snippets</h2>
    <p>Code snippets use a <code>code</code> tag and apply the directive to it <code>[code-display]</code>.</p>
    <div>
<pre class="prettyprint">
  <code code-display>
    <div>
      <h1></h1>
