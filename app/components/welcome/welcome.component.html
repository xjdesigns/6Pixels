  <h1>Hi Jason</h1>
  <p>Current status of 6 pixels: I grabbed all my files from the Indominus Flex project when it was the basis of the framework. This needs a ground up approach for writing. All classes need namespacing. Namespace will be 'spx-'.</p>
  <p>Feel free to contribute to the project anytime with a PR.</p>
  <h2>Guidelines</h2>
  <p>6PIXELS is meant to be a next gen CSS UI FRAMEWORK / PATTERN LAB, and can present progressive enhancement. Please use the <code>@supports</code>. Progressive enhancement code should live at the top of your SCSS file.</p>
