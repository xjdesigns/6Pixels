  <h1>Hi Jason</h1>
  <p>Current status of 6 pixels: I grabbed all my files from the Indominus Flex project when it was the basis of the framework. This needs a ground up approach for writing. All classes need namespacing. Namespace will be 'spx-'.</p>
  <p>Feel free to contribute to the project anytime with a PR.</p>
  <h2>Guidelines</h2>
  <p>6PIXELS is meant to be a next gen CSS UI FRAMEWORK / PATTERN LAB, and can present progressive enhancement. Please use the <code>@supports</code>. Progressive enhancement code should live at the top of your SCSS file.</p>
  <p>Everything should be created with MOBILE FIRST in mind.</p>
  <p>Everything should be in increments of 6 PIXELS. This creates specific patterns and expectations.</p>
  <p>Wih any new elements/components please supply a new route, along with at least one live example and code example.</p>
  <h2>Credit</h2>

  <div class="sg-i-support">
    <div class="sg-supports">This feature uses the CSS rule <code>@supports</code>. If you are viewing in IE or EDGE you will not see any progressive enhancement as it is not supported. <br>If you see the rule below it is supported by your browser.</div>

    <div class="sg-rule-all-initial"><code>all: initial;</code></div>
    <div class="sg-rule-display-grid"><code>display: grid;</code></div>
